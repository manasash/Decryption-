# Encryption and Decryption
Encryption is the way to secure the data, encryption plays its role in protecting sensitive texts, messages by making them to highly classified. 

A lightweight block cipher figure, with little block size and key size, is proper for WSNs, as it is energy effective and gives adequate security in Wireless Sensor Networks. 

Encryption/Decryption process:
                  1.Substitute Bytes Transformation

                  2.ShiftRows Transformation 

                  3.MixColumns Transformation 

                  4.AddRoundKey Transformation
